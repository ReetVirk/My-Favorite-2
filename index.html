        <p id="firstp"> Dragons are my favorite mythical creature because they can be styled in so many different ways. For example, in one book there might be a villian dragon, who is trying to take over the world, and in another, the dragon might be the hero, or a side character who helps the hero. Plus, dragons can be given so many different attributes. One dragon may be able to breathe underwater, while another dragon may shoot flames, and yet another may have no firebreath or water breathing but may be able to camoflauge into any terrain. Dragons are some of the easiest magical creature to put in a book or movie because they can be changed to fit the plot and still be dragons. </p>

        <p> The question is, are dragons real? That's why I chose to write about my favorite mythical creature instead of my favorite book or favorite hobby or something else. All because of that question. So, are dragons real? I believe there is a chance that some sort of dragon-like creature exists, or at least used to exist. Otherwise, how do you explain so many different ancient cultures with evidence pointing towards them believing in dragons? A dragon is a fairly unique creature. Most stories with dragons in them feature a huge beast with horns, claws, a tail, and other varying traits such as wings and fire-breath. While it is possible that one culture somehow told another about dragons, and that culture told another, eventually resulting in many people who believed in dragons, this theory is rather far-fetched, and it makes more sense that several cultures each saw something dragon-like. So... perhaps they exist, perhaps they don't.</p>

        <p> I've been inspired by many books and movies that have dragons in them. They are genuinely entertaining and started my love for fantasy books. I am also inspired that some form of dragons are or were alive at one point in time by stories of other "mythical creatures" that have been proven to be real, such as the giant squid, okapi, and vampire deer. </p>
